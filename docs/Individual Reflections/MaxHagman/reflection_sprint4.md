# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

I want to keep experimenting and learning more about design. Also learn more about react query as it's something we've just added to the project.

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

Outside of the work as a PO I have been working on a new design for our product that is more pleasing. I got the layout, colors and started working on some finer details. I'm not entirely happy with the colors so far but they will work for the design process so far.

For next sprint I would like to ask people for feedback on the design as it's hard to spot everything by yourself when you work with it. In that way i would be able to create a better result.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

We got a good flow this week. I got a few hiccups with the design but eventually got further.
