# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

I want to learn to hold stakeholder meetings better. I tried to research a bit and it still went well but being more organized and prepared would be nice.

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

I contributed by doing the stakeholder meeting and doing my work as Product Owner. I also worked on two tasks this sprint and completed one of them. The other task had a bit of miscommunication so it was not delivered fully.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

There were none last week as this is the first.
