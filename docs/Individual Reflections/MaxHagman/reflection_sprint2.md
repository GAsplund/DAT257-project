# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

I want to learn to how to use prisma properly.

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

I implemented the database and helped some of the team. I also worked on a smaller user story and held the stakeholder meeting.

For the next sprint I can continue to be of assistance to help my teammates when working on the database or other areas that I know more about.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

Still some unclear things but overall I managed the stakeholder meeting better than last week.

We as a team got alot more work done than last week but didn't really manage to push some user stories all the way to get merged before the deadline.
