# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

I feel that this week I'll have to learn more about react query. It will be important for the oncoming sprint.

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

I have finished the design, gotten feedback from the rest of the scrum team, then showed it to potential users and some people interested in design for further feedback before i eventually showed it to our stakeholder. The stakeholder was very happy with the design, only two minor changes was requested. One of which is already fixed and I'm very happy with the result.

For the next sprint I believe that I will have to be available for the oncoming implementation of the new design to answer questions and give feedback. I have discussed the expectations and what the stekholder thinks of the design quite a lot so being able to inform and assist the team with that will probably be important.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

I'm happy I got the chance to run the design through so many people! In total i believe I got 11 others to look at it and give feedback. Without I don't think the stakeholder would have been as happy with the design when I presented it.
