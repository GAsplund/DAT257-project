# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

Know i feel the need to better learn how to design webpages. It's hard to create an aesthetically pleasing site with good navigation

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

This week i helped a lot with planning and helped structurize how we would handle organizations, adding games from users and more related things. In addition to that I also started working on a new design for the site as I assumed that might be what the stakeholder would request next. Just as I thought that was just the case. I haven't been able to contribute much more to the deliveries this week as math has taken up quite a bit of time due to the laboration has a deadline on sunday (now on tuesday as the delayed it later in the week).

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

We did have som planning problems which we have reflected on and learned from. For example, we had the organization discussion after the sprint planning as not everyone would work on it but it lead to story points changing for some user stories. That further lead to an actual increase in the amount of story points we had planned for the week and created more workload. We still managed to complete a lot but if we had the discussion before the sprint planning we would probably have had a better estimate for the week.
