# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Mainly different libraries and technologies we've decided to use for our application. For example, I've never used react so I have to learn how to use that and I also want to understand how our Continuous integration, our GitHub actions and more work. 

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This week I've contributed by mainly learning react so that i will be able to actually code next week, then I also sat with the team when we did the setup of the project so and helped where I could.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
This is my first reflection so no comment here this time.
