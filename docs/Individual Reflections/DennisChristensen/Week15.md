## What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Our login system, I know a little but I'd like to go through it in its entirety so I understand how it actually works.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This week I took on the task of implementing a searchbar which helped me understand how to work with reactive variables in react, as well as how prisma works. Next week I'll be quite busy with Cortègen so I might not be able to spend as much time on the project. I've talked with the team and let them know of this and will instead work extra the week or two after Cortègen.

## Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I've learnt some of the technologies that we use in our project.
