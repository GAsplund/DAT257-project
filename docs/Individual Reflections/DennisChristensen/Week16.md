## What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Same as last week

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This week I've made a seeder script which is be a script to insert some mock data into our database so we have some existing data when manually testing our application.

## Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Not really, as I mentioned in last weeks reflection I've been quite busy with Cortègen this week so haven't been able to spend much time on this project
