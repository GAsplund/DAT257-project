## What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Same as last week.

## What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
Due to my bad internet connection I've had a hard time running the project so instead I've tried to help over Discord where i could. I will be away for most of next week as well so I probably won't be able to do much more next week either.

## Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Yes, this week I've actually had time to help with the project, unfortunately I had worse internet than expected in Vienna so I wasn't able to do as much as I wanted.
