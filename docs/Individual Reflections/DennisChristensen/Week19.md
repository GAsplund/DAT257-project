## What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I'd like to learn how to come up with a good UI for an application. 

## What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
Apart from having a bad internet connection, I've also been quite sick this week so I haven't had much energy to do anything apart from sleeping unfortunately. But I have worked on the graphical design of the application when I had the energy.

## Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Not really, much the same from last week.
