## What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Testing, how to do it effectively and which tests to do at what times and so on.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I haven't worked on anything specific but instead helped were I could this week.

## Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Same as last week, I've been busy with Cortégen since it is on sunday so next week I will be able to work alot more.
