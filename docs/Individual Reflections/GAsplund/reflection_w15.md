# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?  
I want to gain a broader understanding of how communication with the stakeholder should take place, such as how thorough it should be on certain features, and so on.
One part of it could be to discuss what should be done during a sprint, but also if there should be some continuous communication with the stakeholder during the sprint.

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?  
I contributed by discussing on how the program structure should be, but I let other members of the team discuss in more detail what should be used, since I am not yet as familiar with some of the technologies and tools that are used.
I expect this to change during the upcoming sprints as we start working more on our own.
Another part I participated in was setting up documentation and GitHub workflows for automated building and testing.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?  
Since this is the first reflection, there are no changes.
