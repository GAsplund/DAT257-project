# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?  
I want to understand better how our user authentication works, and how it is used to check things in relation to the currently logged in user.
Given I had low to zero part in building our connection to authentication, I want to learn how to interact with it so that I can make my own features better.

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?  
I contributed this week by adding game ratings, with both backend and frontend.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?  
With most, if not all, groundwork done for users and organizations, I feel that I could build complete features that properly link with other parts of the application.
