# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
This week I learned a lot about building UI's with react/nextJS. I have also learned how to handle state in react and query data with react-query.


# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This week I have mainly worked on the UI for the site admin page that will manage the organizations. In connection to this I also had to update the backend a bit to support the new UI. I have also reviewed some of the other teams code and helped them with some issues they had.
Overall it feels like a lot of the features we have planned are starting to come together but we need to do a big UI push to get everything to look good.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Overall I feel like this week is quite similar to last week but with a bit more focus on the UI. I also feel like we are on track to finish the project on time and that we have a good team dynamic.
