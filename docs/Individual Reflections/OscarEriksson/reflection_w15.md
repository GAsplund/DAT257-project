# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I have basically never worked with react/NodeJS before so I have been learning that this week.

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I have helped set up the project and Docker build files. I have also helped set up our CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions. Next sprint I will probably be trying to write some actual project code.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
As this it the first week I don't have anything to compare to.
