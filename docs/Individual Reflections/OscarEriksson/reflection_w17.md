# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I have learned more about oauth and how groups works with gamma. I have also learned more about how to work with passport js to validate the logins.


# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This week I have mainly worked on adding organizations to the project. These organizations are connected to groups within gamma so members can be automatically added based on the information from gamma. I also started working on a site admin UI to manage the organizations. 
As a team we have also discussed and decided how we want to structure game ownerships.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I would say that this week feels like a continuation of last week with me moving from auth to orgs. Everything is proceeding to plan and I feel like we are on track to finish the project on time. I also feel like we have a good team dynamic and that we are able to help each other when needed.
