# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I have learned a lot about how to work with node/type script as well as how oath works with gamma (IT sections authentication system). 


# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This week I have mainly worked on getting logins to work. This was a big task but I managed to get it working after looking at another project that had a similar setup with oath authentication against gamma. I also had som help from the other team members.
Next week I think I will be working on adding organizations/groups to the system.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I felt like things have been going well this week. I have been able to get a lot done and I have been able to help the other team members with their tasks as well. I have also been able to get a lot of help from the other team members when I have needed it. Compared to last week it feels like we have gotten a lot more done this week.
