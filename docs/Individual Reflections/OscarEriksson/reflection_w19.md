# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
This week i did some detective work to figure out how to prevent express from crashing when an endpoint thru an error and figured out that the solution was to update to the preview of the next release.
I also learned how to do fancy input validation in the frontend using zod and react-hook-form.


# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This week I started with some detective work to figure out why the backend crashed when an endpoint threw an error. As it turned out the only non hacky solution was to update express to the preview of the next release (5.0).
We felt this was acceptable since the release is only a few months away and is generally stable.
I also did some work on the frontend to make the UI look better and to add input validation to all out forms. In combination with input validation I also added feedback of whether the operation was successful or not.
I also reviewed some of the other teams code and helped them with some issues they had.
Next week the plan is to do a big UI push to get everything to look good.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
It feels like the team is working well together and that we are on track to finish the project on time. So not much has changed since last week.
