# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
What I want to learn more about is frontend deveelopment.

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I have mainly reviewed code and fixed bugs in our code this week. By also focusing on pair coding I could probably help my team a bit more next sprint.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I feel like I have succeeded with my goals from last sprint, but I feel like I probably could have been even more active.
