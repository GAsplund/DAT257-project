# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
One thing I really want to learn more about the coming week is how to write acceptance criterias for my User stories, we've had some problems the past weeks with acceptance criterias being skipped or understood differently when writing/reviewing code.

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I have finished a couple of user stories this week, and moreover tried to fix some of the bugs, as well as our broken documentation and helping with some code reviews. Next sprin I'd like to focus harder on reviewing PR:s and even more on user stories.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I feel like I have succeeded with my goals from last sprint, but I feel like I probably could have been even more active.
