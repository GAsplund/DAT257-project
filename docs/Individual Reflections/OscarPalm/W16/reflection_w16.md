# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
I want to get a better understanding on how to work with databases as well as getting a better understanding about how to score user stories in a better way.

I still want to learn more about databases and how to use them, even though I've become somewhat better at it

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I have mainly worked on getting testing to work as well as how to borrow games, while borrowing is done, testing still has some work t odo on it, meaning nothing has been merged yet.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I haven't had as much available time as last week, due to exercises and stuff in the course running parallell, hopefully I can work a bit more next week ðŸ˜…
