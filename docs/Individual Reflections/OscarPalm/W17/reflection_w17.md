# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
I want to focus on learning communication in teamwork a bit better, to not sit for hours trying to fix your code instead of asking for help, we are a team and that's a great resource to utilize.

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I have added the ability to filter games shown, as well as helped with writing the code for deleting games from the website. I could probably help my team more the next sprint by trying to be a bit more active in our team discord and helping in answering questions as well as trying to keep everyone up to date on what's going on in the project.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have had much more free time to work on the project, meaning I've got more things done. I have also started to help people a bit more with their features instead of mostly focusing on my own =)
