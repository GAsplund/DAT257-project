### What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

This week, I realized that I had misunderstood the definition of done, and I want to increase my understanding of this concept. I recognize that having a clear definition of done is essential for ensuring that our team delivers high-quality work that meets our customers' expectations. Therefore, I plan to discuss it with my colleagues to ensure that we are all on the same page.

### What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

This week, I contributed to the team's deliveries by making larger structural changes while also implementing new features. I believe that my contributions helped improve the overall quality of our product and helped us move closer to our sprint goals. Looking forward, I want to continue to be an active participant in the team's work and explore ways to improve our collaboration and communication.

### Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

In my reflection from last week, I mentioned that I wanted to work more independently to better the product. I am happy to report that I made progress towards this goal this week. I took ownership of some tasks and worked on my own to complete them, which allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the product and improve its functionality. I will continue to seek opportunities to work independently while also collaborating effectively with my teammates.
