### What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

This week we introduced React Query to the codebase, which I would like to learn more about. I have used React Query before, but I have never used it in a group project. I am interested in learning more about how to use React Query in a team setting and how to integrate it with our existing codebase.

### What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

This week, I implemented features such as GameOwner, which is a bit of a workaround for the fact that both organizations and users can own games. This was relatively complex, but is a requirement for the others to finish their jobs.

### Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

This week I have learnt about and truly understand the definition of done. I have also done a lot of independent work which is nice.
