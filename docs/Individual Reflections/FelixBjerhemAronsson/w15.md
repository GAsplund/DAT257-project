# What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?  
I would like to be better at testing. At the current moment, I have no idea how to correctly write things such as integration tests (especially for Node.js and Express). This is something I would like to become better at to both help increase the code quality across the codebase, but also to teach me a new skill that could be useful in my future career.

# What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
My contributions this sprint has mostly been focused on setting up the project, i.e. setup basic testing environment, GitHub actions as well as the project structure as a whole. Additionally, I created the first piece of "functionality", meaning the first API endpoint for getting the games and setup the initial website design and framework for development.

Next sprint I hope to help my team by setting up the basic testing methodologies that I brushed on earlier, so that we can have more reliable code in the future. Similarly I hope to share in my experience using Node.js and Express to help the less experienced members of our team.

# Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?  
Last week there was no reflection, since we had no sprint. Therefore it's quite hard to comment on any improvements. Hopefully there will be lots here next time! :D
