### What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

After working a bit with React Query, I realized I want to learn how to better extract functionality into React Hooks, as it seems to enable very clean and readable code if done correctly.

### What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

This week I implemented relatively few features, but converted the codebase to use React Query, which enabled a lot of QOL changes. Similairly, I went through multiple parts and refactored, making it a lot easier to implement new features in the future. I also implemented a few tests and made the filtering system more robust and easier to use, so that you don't have to submit a form to use it.

### Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

I've learnt a lot about React Query and how to use it, especially in a team setting. I also contributed a lot, doing maybe twice the amount of story points compared to the previous week.
